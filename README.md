# Accordion

NOTE: Unfortunately this is a project I've not had the time to actually implement, and it doesn't look like I will have that time for the forseeable future, so I'd like to release this crate name back into the crates.io ecosystem!

As such: I consent to the transfer of this crate to the first person who asks help@crates.io for it.

Enjoy the crate name and build great things!
